Ever since I started feeling less ashamed of talking in English I feel my mind config has been modified. I tend to think in English even when it's native language.

I'm not a great English speaker nor I am fully confident in my level, but I can't help it. I've always been obsesed with logical thinking and how I should put all of my effort on it since that was the only way in my mind to treat everybody the same. Little did I know.
